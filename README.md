# üí´ About Me:
As a dedicated 3rd-year Information Technology student, I have a profound passion for the realm of cybersecurity and ethical hacking. I firmly believe in the importance of a secure digital world, not just as a necessity, but as a fundamental right. My academic journey has equipped me with a strong foundation in IT, complemented by certifications in Ethical Hacking, CISSP, and Cyber Security from SkillUP by Simplilearn. Beyond the theoretical knowledge, I have diligently honed my practical hacking skills and actively seek opportunities to push my boundaries. I've participated in hands-on cybersecurity workshops and simulations, applying my learning to real-world scenarios, highlighting the ever-evolving nature of this field. As I transition from academia to the professional world, my eagerness to collaborate with seasoned cybersecurity experts and thought leaders knows no bounds. I don't merely aim to be a passive learner; I'm here to contribute, innovate, and play a pivotal role in shaping a secure digital future for all.
